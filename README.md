country-vis
-----------

A not-very-geographical way to visualise country-country flows (with optional categories of flow)

Currently does the following seemingly-pointless things:

- Draws the outline of each country in the world such that they all fit into a
box of the same size
- Starts these boxes off at the location of the centroid of the country in
"real life"
- Runs a force layout with no overlapping to send all these boxes flying into
the middle of the visualisation in (broadly) the same "order" that they
started out.
